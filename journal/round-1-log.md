# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 01/09/21

**End date**: XX/XX/XX

## Goals

* Complete Responsive Web Design Certification
* Complete JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
* Continue coding for an hour each day

## Day 1 - 1/9/21

* **Project You Are Working On:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/KKgZzNN) for the first of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress Today:** Redid the page so it looks more presentable, while still fulfilling the user stories
  * Added a rounded border to the text at the bottom
  * Adjusted margins to get rid of the gaps in the header, and beneath the image
  * Moved the article element below the image instead of next to it. Just misc stuff to make it look neater and more readable
* **Challenges you faced:** I'm not a visual design person. I want to redo these projects to give them more style instead of just blocks of text on a block of background color, but it's been hard to figure out just what to add or change to make it look nicer. I feel like that's one of the biggest issues I'm gonna face with the next four projects. Looking forward to finishing them so I can get back to working with Javascript, lol.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Complete the survey page project, and fix the mobile view on the technical documentation page, if there's time

## Day 2 - 1/10/21
 Another one down! One more project until I get the Web Design certification.
 
* **Project you are working on:** [Survey Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/BaLORmw) the second of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress today:** Built the survey page
* **Challenges you faced:** Getting the colors right. Honestly it's not the *best* it could be, right now. I'd wanted black text but that blended in with the background image too much so I changed it to a light colored text, but it still feels like it might not be all that readable.. Ugh.
On the bright side, though, these are design issues. I understand the code to change the colors. I'm just not so great on finding the right colors. I'm calling it a win.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Gonna hold off on making the portfolio page until I'm happy with the first four projects (because I'm an insane perfectionist ope) so tomorrow I'll focus on sprucing up the technical documentation page, and redoing the product landing page.

## Day 3 - 1/11/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
* **Progress today:** Adjusted the Nav bar so the links grow and change color when you hover over them. Centered the header under the nav bar at the top
* **Challenges you faced:** Spent way too much time trying to find colors that went well together, and "centering" under just the nav bar links, instead of the logo as well took some time to figure out. And honestly I'm sure there's a better way to do it than guess and check over and over but oh well. The end result looks all right.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Product Landing page

## Day 4 - 1/12/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
* **Progress today:** I got it done, I guess. Put the video in a fixed position on the left under the logo so there isnt just the empty space. Adjusted the margins so that the links jump to the right areas on the page without hiding the head under the nav bar. Centered everything and changed the fonts. Not great, but not awful. I'm not doing anything else with this one
* **Challenges you faced:** Centering everything under the right 7/8 of a page instead of the full page was a huge pain. Adjusting the top margins worked so the links jump to the right place but it adds ugly gaps that I'd prefer not be there.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Personal Portfolio webpage

## Day 5 - 1/13/21

* **Project you are working on:** A new and improved [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/rNMQWeJ) and my [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
* **Progress today:**
   * on the product page: Fixed (some) alignment issues, added color and just made it look a little less boring, and removed the video (needed one to pass the assignment for FCC, but I much prefer the way it looks without)
   * On the Portfolio: Made navbar with links aligned left
   * Started playing around with colors, not sure what exactly I'm going with yet
* **Challenges you faced:** had trouble aligning the navbar links to the right without them showing up in reverse order. honestly I fixed it by accident, I couldnt tell you which change finally had the desired result. having trouble settling on colors but I think I'm going to leave that for last.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** finish, hopefully, the portfolio

## Day 6 - 1/14/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
* **Progress today:** Finished it! Settled on a color scheme, got the different sections added and linked to the nav bar. Added the images for the projects section and added some hover effects to different things. I think it looks all right
* **Challenges you faced:** God, so many. Centering the Welcome section took me way too long. I'd just wanted the name and subtitle on top of each other, but sentering one element in the div left the other one next to it instead of below it and nothing I did fixed that, so I improvised... But the result looks pretty good, I think. Sizing the images properly too a bit of time too but honestly less than I expected. 
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Start again with Javascript!

## Day 7 - 1/15/21

* **Project you are working on:** No projects yet, just reviewing JS
* **Progress today:** Started going back over the early JS lessons.
* **Challenges you faced:** None, really. Just how to skip the basic stuff I already know without missing small details I may have forgotten. Don't think there's a way so I'm just going over all of it. Which means probably several days of review.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** More JS review.

## Day 8 - 1/16/21

* **Project you are working on:** More review
* **Progress today:** Got just about through the Basic Javascript section
* **Challenges you faced:** spent like 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with something I'd written that *seemed* to be giving the right results. Turns out the code was right except I'd forgotten to change console.log() back to return once I'd fixed my mistake. Definitely felt dumb there. Now I'm stuck on updating nested arrays in an array of objects. I've tried two solutions. One solves one problem but creates another. Then solving the new problem brings the old one back. I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing wrong, but I've spent enough time on it for today, I'll come back to it in the morning.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** More review. Finishing this section and hopefully the ES6 section, if there's time.

## Day 9 - 1/17/21

* **Project you are working on:** Record Collection challenge on FCC
* **Progress today:** None! An hour working on this thing and I'm not any closer to figuring it out
* **Challenges you faced:** Having trouble with accessing nested objects like, dynamically or whatever. Using a function to update them. I keep getting "cannot set/read property of undefined" when like... they are defined? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Read up on objects like, outside of the freecodecamp lessons. Theres something I'm not understanding about how they work, I'm hoping a deeper dive than the lessons provided so far will help me
