# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 01/09/21

**End date**: XX/XX/XX

## Goals

-   Complete Responsive Web Design Certification
-   Complete JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
-   Continue coding for an hour each day

## Day 1 - 1/9/21

-   **Project You Are Working On:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/KKgZzNN) for the first of the FCC web design projects.
-   **Progress Today:** Redid the page so it looks more presentable, while still fulfilling the user stories
    -   Added a rounded border to the text at the bottom
    -   Adjusted margins to get rid of the gaps in the header, and beneath the image
    -   Moved the article element below the image instead of next to it. Just misc stuff to make it look neater and more readable
-   **Challenges you faced:** I'm not a visual design person. I want to redo these projects to give them more style instead of just blocks of text on a block of background color, but it's been hard to figure out just what to add or change to make it look nicer. I feel like that's one of the biggest issues I'm gonna face with the next four projects. Looking forward to finishing them so I can get back to working with Javascript, lol.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Complete the survey page project, and fix the mobile view on the technical documentation page, if there's time

## Day 2 - 1/10/21

 Another one down! One more project until I get the Web Design certification.

-   **Project you are working on:** [Survey Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/BaLORmw) the second of the FCC web design projects.
-   **Progress today:** Built the survey page
-   **Challenges you faced:** Getting the colors right. Honestly it's not the _best_ it could be, right now. I'd wanted black text but that blended in with the background image too much so I changed it to a light colored text, but it still feels like it might not be all that readable.. Ugh.
    On the bright side, though, these are design issues. I understand the code to change the colors. I'm just not so great on finding the right colors. I'm calling it a win.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Gonna hold off on making the portfolio page until I'm happy with the first four projects (because I'm an insane perfectionist ope) so tomorrow I'll focus on sprucing up the technical documentation page, and redoing the product landing page.

## Day 3 - 1/11/21

-   **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
-   **Progress today:** Adjusted the Nav bar so the links grow and change color when you hover over them. Centered the header under the nav bar at the top
-   **Challenges you faced:** Spent way too much time trying to find colors that went well together, and "centering" under just the nav bar links, instead of the logo as well took some time to figure out. And honestly I'm sure there's a better way to do it than guess and check over and over but oh well. The end result looks all right.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Product Landing page

## Day 4 - 1/12/21

-   **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
-   **Progress today:** I got it done, I guess. Put the video in a fixed position on the left under the logo so there isnt just the empty space. Adjusted the margins so that the links jump to the right areas on the page without hiding the head under the nav bar. Centered everything and changed the fonts. Not great, but not awful. I'm not doing anything else with this one
-   **Challenges you faced:** Centering everything under the right 7/8 of a page instead of the full page was a huge pain. Adjusting the top margins worked so the links jump to the right place but it adds ugly gaps that I'd prefer not be there.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Personal Portfolio webpage

## Day 5 - 1/13/21

-   **Project you are working on:** A new and improved [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/rNMQWeJ) and my [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
-   **Progress today:**
    -   on the product page: Fixed (some) alignment issues, added color and just made it look a little less boring, and removed the video (needed one to pass the assignment for FCC, but I much prefer the way it looks without)
    -   On the Portfolio: Made navbar with links aligned left
    -   Started playing around with colors, not sure what exactly I'm going with yet
-   **Challenges you faced:** had trouble aligning the navbar links to the right without them showing up in reverse order. honestly I fixed it by accident, I couldnt tell you which change finally had the desired result. having trouble settling on colors but I think I'm going to leave that for last.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** finish, hopefully, the portfolio

## Day 6 - 1/14/21

-   **Project you are working on:** [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
-   **Progress today:** Finished it! Settled on a color scheme, got the different sections added and linked to the nav bar. Added the images for the projects section and added some hover effects to different things. I think it looks all right
-   **Challenges you faced:** God, so many. Centering the Welcome section took me way too long. I'd just wanted the name and subtitle on top of each other, but sentering one element in the div left the other one next to it instead of below it and nothing I did fixed that, so I improvised... But the result looks pretty good, I think. Sizing the images properly too a bit of time too but honestly less than I expected.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Start again with Javascript!

## Day 7 - 1/15/21

-   **Project you are working on:** No projects yet, just reviewing JS
-   **Progress today:** Started going back over the early JS lessons.
-   **Challenges you faced:** None, really. Just how to skip the basic stuff I already know without missing small details I may have forgotten. Don't think there's a way so I'm just going over all of it. Which means probably several days of review.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** More JS review.

## Day 8 - 1/16/21

-   **Project you are working on:** More review
-   **Progress today:** Got just about through the Basic Javascript section
-   **Challenges you faced:** spent like 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with something I'd written that _seemed_ to be giving the right results. Turns out the code was right except I'd forgotten to change console.log() back to return once I'd fixed my mistake. Definitely felt dumb there. Now I'm stuck on updating nested arrays in an array of objects. I've tried two solutions. One solves one problem but creates another. Then solving the new problem brings the old one back. I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing wrong, but I've spent enough time on it for today, I'll come back to it in the morning.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** More review. Finishing this section and hopefully the ES6 section, if there's time.

## Day 9 - 1/17/21

-   **Project you are working on:** Record Collection challenge on FCC
-   **Progress today:** None! An hour working on this thing and I'm not any closer to figuring it out
-   **Challenges you faced:** Having trouble with accessing nested objects like, dynamically or whatever. Using a function to update them. I keep getting "cannot set/read property of undefined" when like... they are defined? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Read up on objects like, outside of the freecodecamp lessons. Theres something I'm not understanding about how they work, I'm hoping a deeper dive than the lessons provided so far will help me

## Day 10 - 1/18/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** None at the moment
-   **Progress today:** Very little. If it can even be considered progress. I'm still stuck on this nested objects/"undefined" thing. I've watched a few videos that basically went over what I already knew and reinforced my belief that it should be working... In addition to the videos, I spent some time looking back over my old projects. Theyre still beyond me. That's what I get for my JS speedrun before quitting for several months. Anyway I'm going to ask for some help tomorrow, maybe he'll show me what it is that I'm missing here. I know there was no actual coding today so it feels a bit like cheating, but I worked towards increasing my understanding at least.
-   **Challenges you faced:** See above.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Ask Rev.

## Day 11 - 1/19/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** The record collection challenge on freeCodeCamp
-   **Progress today:** So as it turns out, I just had two numbers mixed up. The entire issue with the "undefined" error message was caused by me using id# 5349 instead of 5439. Unfortunately I'm now stuck on a different aspect of this challenge. It's one I think I understand how to figure out, though. So I'm hoping tomorrow is my last day stuck on this.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Checking if the 'tracks' property exists already. I figured _if ( object[id][prop] )_  would return either true or false, but _if ( object[id][prop] == false)_ had unexpected results. So I tried switching it to _if ( object[id][prop] != true )_ but that only fixed one part but caused a problem with another.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Figure out a better way to check if the property exists. Then finish the collection challenge and move on.

## Day 12 - 1/21/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Record Collection challenge, and the rest of the Basic JS lessons
-   **Progress today:** Finally completed that challenge! Got through a few more of the lessons, watched a couple videos on recursion.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Not so much a challenge, since I was able to complete it, but is _if (!object[id]\[prop])_ not the same as _if (object[id]\[prop] != true)_? I solved this one but I'm a bit confused as to why it worked. I was also a bit confused by recursion, but I think I'm starting to understand a bit better.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** the profile lookup challenge, and whatever other lessons there's time for.

## Day 13 - 1/22/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** basic JS section of the Javascript course
-   **Progress today:** completed the profileLookup function and some more sections about Math.random() and Math.floor()
-   **Challenges you faced:** I thought I understood recursion but this code that looks like it should be working just... isn't. Gonna watch some more videos on it and try to figure out why I'm stuck
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** understand recursion so I can finish the countdown function and finally move on to the next JS section

## Day 14 - 1/23/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Basic JS lessons
-   **Progress today:** Completed the countdown function using recursion, watched more videos on recursion
-   **Challenges you faced:** creating a recursive function that lists a range of numbers. I keep thinking I have recursion down, just to completely lose it again.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish this function. I'm on the last of the basic JS challenges.

## Day 15 - 1/24/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Range of numbers function using recursion
-   **Progress today:** Finally got it done!
-   **Challenges you faced:** I really felt like i understood the concept of recursion but I was struggling when it came to what was being returned, how to store that info into an array without the array changing when the function is called again, etc
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Move on to the ES6 module

## Day 16 - 1/25/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** ES6 section on FreeCodeCamp
-   **Progress today:** Got about halfway through this section. A lot of this is coming back to me really easily.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I'm stuck on getters and setters. This is something that I'm struggling a bit to understand, but I remember that I had trouble understanding them last time too, so Im not letting that discourage me.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the ES6 section and get started on the next one.

## Day 17 - 1/26/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** ES6 section
-   **Progress today:** Finished it. Realized the reason I'd been struggling with getters and setters is that I'd been thinking about them way too hard. It's way more straightforward than I was making it out to be, and that had me stuck on a challenge for a good 10 minutes. But! I got it figured out, and completed the rest of this section.
-   **Challenges you faced:** There was that challenge I was stuck on, but that wasn't too bad. To be honest though, I did stop after 45 minutes because the next section is Regex and I absolutely hated this section. Not at all looking forward to picking this back up, so I'm leaving it for another day
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** ugh... start the regex section

## Day 18 - 1/27/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Regex lessons
-   **Progress today:** Got a few of the exercises done and honestly I can't remember why I hated them so much. It's all broken down, at least so far, in a way that's really easy to understand. And I'm going through them slower now, to really retain the information.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I also logged into codewars hoping to do some of the challenges on there but they quickly ventured back into stuff I don't remember so I think I'll have to wait til I've done a bit more of the JS lessons before I can start those. I'd like to be able to work on that along with my lessons though.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** More regex lessons

## Day 19 - 1/29/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Regex lessons
-   **Progress today:** Got some more of the exercises done
-   **Challenges you faced:** I'm really just struggling with like. Idk, maybe I'm just trying to do too much when I'm tired but I'm having trouble remembering what each symbol does like, as soon as I move on to the next challenge. Or mixing up what they do. I'm gonna take a break from the regex for a bit and work on something else tomorrow I think.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Start a different section

## Day 20 - 1/30/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Following along with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc&t=335s) javascript game tutorial,working on the Memory Game
-   **Progress today:** Followed along with the video to make the game. No actual original code today, I just focused on understanding what she was doing and why.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I havent done a lot of like, JS and HTML together. So I'm not used to like, querySelector and addEventListener and stuff like that. Most of it becomes obvious pretty quickly, but I want to start working on projects that require both, so I can get more experience with like the actual application of Javascript outside of just the challenges on freeCodeCamp
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Styling the memory game

## Day 21 - 1/31/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** A simple browser math game, using JS and HTML
-   **Progress today:** It's something. Clicking "start game" generates a randum equation and leaves a space to input an answer. Clicking enter returns whether you were right or not. It's completely style-less right now. But, it's a whole functioning thing, with code I wrote myself instead of following a tutorial. I'm excited.
-   **Challenges you faced:** It took me forever to figure out how to access the input, to check if the answer was correct. I'm also not sure how to, like, allow it to reset. Right now it only runs once. Clicking start game a second time won't generate a new problem.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Figure out how to add a "new game" sort of function. Or maybe just have it automatically create a new problem once the first one is solved.

## Day 22 - 02/01/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game
-   **Progress today:** There's a start button that covers the page now, that's hidden once you start the game. Added images and a hint button, to show the images when clicked. Added a reset button that clears the screen and generates a new problem. Um, a lot more little things. Chose a font I liked and started adding some styling, but very little so far.
-   **Challenges you faced:** As always I'm struggling with centering things, and getting the width and height right. It took me a minute to figure out how to add in the images, but I like how it turned out.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Mess around some more with the buttons and when they're displayed/hidden. Maybe have it throw an error if you hit enter without entering a number? Also find a way to include subtraction as long as x > y.

## Day 23 - 02/02/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game
-   **Progress today:** Basically none. I spent a lot of time figuring out what _wouldn't_ work, so there's some progress in that, right? But, that's how I spent all my time so, as far as actual measurable progress on the game, no, I didn't make any.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I wanted to add several images based on the numbers being added, like basically insert the picture x times, then the plus symbol, then the first picture again y times. But then I wanted that to be cleared once The equation was reset. I was trying to use appendChild() but I could only get that to insert one picture.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Figure something out for the images, and then do some more work with the css

## Day 24 - 02/03/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game
-   **Progress today:** So much! I added subtraction, so it'll be either plus or minus randomly, and will show the bigger number first so that the answer is never a negative number. Fixed the centering issue with the buttons, and made some progress getting the images showing up where and when I want them to.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Struggling with margins for the form. I'm missing something, I can't get rid of the gap between everything.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Fix the image issue, so that if the right one shows up first (had 6-4 come up but the 4 image appeared first). Then change the results display

## Day 25 - 02/05/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game for a bit, then just review
-   **Progress today:** On the game, I fixed the issue where the images weren't necessarily corresponding to the numbers. That was easy enough. Then I just did some review with the Grasshopper app on my phone
-   **Challenges you faced:** None, really. It was a boring review day
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Get coding in earlier in the day so I can actually work on it instead of having to try to squeeze it in between calls at work. Ope.

## Day 26 - 02/06/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Completing the projects on the Sololearn app for the js certificate
-   **Progress today:** completed 5 of the 6 Javascript projects on the Sololearn app. (That sounds like a lot but they were surprisingly simple and straightforward).
-   **Challenges you faced:** I was stuck for an embarrassingly long time because I guess I forgot that the condition in for loops doesn't have to be based on the.. iterator? Idk the term. So... _for(let i=0; [condition]; i++)_ that condition doesn't have to check the value of i, it can be based on other variables. Which should be obvious but man it had me stuck.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** work on the final "words" project and then do more of the js challenges. (I suck at finding time during the day. I'll be back to work on the math game when I'm off on Wed lol)

## Day 27 - 02/07/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game
-   **Progress today:** Some basic styling stuff. Changed the position of the Next Round button, to replace the Enter button once a correct answer's been entered. Changed the wrong answer message to "Sorry, try again" and removed the "Next Round" prompt until the correct answer is put in.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Found a bug where sometimes the "difference" function which should be pretty straightforward, sometimes wants the sum instead. Only sometimes. I'm not sure what's causing it to mess up. The addition seems to be working fine, it only glitches when it's subtraction. Also found a bug that caused 9-10 to come up. The problems should only ever have the bigger number listed first so that the answer is never a negative number. Strangely enough, the answer it was looking for was 1, so it was calculating 10-9 but it just didn't create the right string.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Work on refactoring. I've been kind of adding things as I think of them which has led to a jumbled mess of code. I think some refactoring will help me find the source of the problems, as well as make the code more readable.

## Day 28 - 02/08/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Math Game
-   **Progress today:**  Fixed the bugs that I found yesterday. Added comments to the javascript, explaining what is where and why, to make it easier to understand.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Took me a minute to find the source of the bug that was wanting a wrong answer when some equations came up. It wasn’t that it was expecting a wrong answer some of the time, it’s that the equations happened to match the expected answer some of the time. But the answer itself was never changing from the first one
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Add the streak counter, and then work on css. Style the buttons and add some color

## Day 29 - 02/09/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Learning to use Github
-   **Progress today:** Created Repository for the [Math Game](https://github.com/AprilBlossoms/Math-Game) and linked to the [game itself](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Challenges you faced:** Being intimidated. Github intimidates me. I'm slowly working past that.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the game! Add the streak counter, then make everything look pretty

## Day 30 - 02/10/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** [Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** Added player name prompt and a "congratulations {player name}" screen once the game is completed. A progress bar at the top that completes the game after 10 correct answers. Lots of styling stuff. Got images and a background, and finally figured out how to fix the spacing issues I was having trouble with.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Figuring out how to make the image move took me a minute. And the initial method I used to fix the spacing completely ruined the display of the equation so I had to find a different way to do that. Most of the issues I had today centered around.. uh, centering things lol, and just positioning them in general. But I think I have a better understanding of that now.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Style the buttons that I've been putting off since I started this project.

## Day 31 - 02/11/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** [Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** Added autofocus on the inputs. Made a lot of style changes, added some background color to improve readability. Changed the progress bar to be based on % rather than px.  
-   **Challenges you faced:** Figuring out how to change the focus, and make it constantly on the input except at the start page.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Refactoring

## Day 32 - 02/13/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** [Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** No changes as far asc functionality goes. I'm working on refactoring. I've combined the Start page and the Congratulations page with the new game prompt into one, but I'm not sure if that's actually going to be more efficient, to change the text that's displayed, as opposed to just having completely seperate elements. I could maybe put the form tag around the whole thing, so I don't have the need for the second button.. I'm still toying with it, we'll see. Anyway, I did this in a new branch so that I can mess around with it without screwing up the real game. Also so I can get used to how github works. It's very intimidating for me still.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I didn't realize how much my poor naming skills would come back to bite me in the ass. I'm so grateful for the "find" option in atom because when I decided to start renaming things to be more organized, I didn't think about how much scavenger hunt it would become to update that particular name _everywhere_ in the file. Also, I suck at naming. Which seems like a minor problem but I keep being unsure. Do I call the input player-name because that's the information it'll be getting? No, should it be player-name-prompt because the space is only the prompt and whats entered is the player name? Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Decide on a way to set up the start/new game pages, and then start styling the buttons.

## Day 33 - 02/14/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** [Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** I moved the Congrats screen into a separate element of the new game screen.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Well, it doesn't work. I thought I could hide one element and when needed, change the display of each. And in theory it's set up right, but now something about the way it detects the game being won isn't working.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Make it work, I guess.

## Day 34 - 02/15/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** freeCodeCamp Javascript lessons
-   **Progress today:** Finished the debugging section
-   **Challenges you faced:** none, really. just tired
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** probably more of the javascript lessons. I'll get back to the math game on my next day off.

## Day 35 - 02/16/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Sololearn Lessons
-   **Progress today:** Made it through most of them, about mid-way through the ES6 lessons.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I don't understand destructuring, but it wasn't so much a "challenge" because when I got to it I was already at the end of lessons for the night. Hopefully it'll make more sense when I come back to it.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Back to the Math Game

## Day 36 - 02/17/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** [Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** Fixed it! I finally combined the start display and the you won/new game display into one, and got the game to continue working right.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I'm embarrassed to say the problem was my misunderstanding of "id" and "class." I thought they were basically the same thing and didn't get why we'd ever need both. Which was me missing a HUGE aspect of what can be done and ways that SO MUCH can be simplified. So, figuring that out took a minute. But I got it now!
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Style the buttons and work on more ways to organize the code.

## Day 37 - 02/19/2021

-   **Project you are working on:**[Math Game](https://aprilblossoms.github.io/Math-Game/)
-   **Progress today:** I turned off the autocomplete when you were entering numbers.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Really struggling getting the focus onto the new game button once the game's completed. I'm trying to make the game work completely without using the mouse so once the "You Won" page pops focus is already on the button so you can just press enter to begin again. As far as I can tell, nothing I'm doing is putting the focus there.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Maybe it's because something earlier in the code is focusing on something else. Look into that. Fix the focus issue and then work on the sololearn lessons some more, while I work.

## Day 38 - 02/20/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Sololearn HTML lessons
-   **Progress today:** Completed the lessons, but there wasn't really any practice options. (Unless you pay for the *pro* version, which I'm not going to do, lol)
-   **Challenges you faced:** None. Again, this app is really great for review, which is perfect since that's what I'm doing with HTML. But there weren't really any parts that challenged me.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** More Sololearn lessons

## Day 39 - 02/22/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** jQuery lessons, on sololearn
-   **Progress today:** got through the first two modules
-   **Challenges you faced:** None so far. Even though it's all technically new, it feels a lot like review. Like just a new way to apply all these concepts I already know. I'm already thinking of the ways I can apply this to the math game to help with the organization
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the jquery section, and then see how I can use it on my current projects

## Day 40 - 02/23/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** freeCodeCamp front end library course
-   **Progress today:** Completed the bootstrap section and started the jQuery one
-   **Challenges you faced:** None. I really wish I'd started this stuff way sooner. It's so straightforward and easy to understand. At least so far (fingers crossed, lol)
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Work on this course some more
