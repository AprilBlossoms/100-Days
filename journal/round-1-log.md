# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 01/09/20

**End date**: XX/XX/XX

## Goals

* Complete Responsive Web Design Certification
* Complete JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
* Continue coding for an hour each day

## Day 1 - 1/9/20

* **Project You Are Working On:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/KKgZzNN) for the first of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress Today:** Redid the page so it looks more presentable, while still fulfilling the user stories
  * Added a rounded border to the text at the bottom
  * Adjusted margins to get rid of the gaps in the header, and beneath the image
  * Moved the article element below the image instead of next to it. Just misc stuff to make it look neater and more readable
* **Challenges you faced:** I'm not a visual design person. I want to redo these projects to give them more style instead of just blocks of text on a block of background color, but it's been hard to figure out just what to add or change to make it look nicer. I feel like that's one of the biggest issues I'm gonna face with the next four projects. Looking forward to finishing them so I can get back to working with Javascript, lol.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Complete the survey page project, and fix the mobile view on the technical documentation page, if there's time

## Day 2 - 1/10/20
 Another one down! One more project until I get the Web Design certification.
 
* **Project you are working on:** [Survey Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/BaLORmw) the second of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress today:** Built the survey page
* **Challenges you faced:** Getting the colors right. Honestly it's not the *best* it could be, right now. I'd wanted black text but that blended in with the background image too much so I changed it to a light colored text, but it still feels like it might not be all that readable.. Ugh.
On the bright side, though, these are design issues. I understand the code to change the colors. I'm just not so great on finding the right colors. I'm calling it a win.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Gonna hold off on making the portfolio page until I'm happy with the first four projects (because I'm an insane perfectionist ope) so tomorrow I'll focus on sprucing up the technical documentation page, and redoing the product landing page.
