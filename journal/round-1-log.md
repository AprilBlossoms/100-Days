# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 01/09/20

**End date**: XX/XX/XX

## Goals

* Complete Responsive Web Design Certification
* Complete JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
* Continue coding for an hour each day

## Day 1 - 1/9/20

* **Project You Are Working On:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/KKgZzNN) for the first of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress Today:** Redid the page so it looks more presentable, while still fulfilling the user stories
  * Added a rounded border to the text at the bottom
  * Adjusted margins to get rid of the gaps in the header, and beneath the image
  * Moved the article element below the image instead of next to it. Just misc stuff to make it look neater and more readable
* **Challenges you faced:** I'm not a visual design person. I want to redo these projects to give them more style instead of just blocks of text on a block of background color, but it's been hard to figure out just what to add or change to make it look nicer. I feel like that's one of the biggest issues I'm gonna face with the next four projects. Looking forward to finishing them so I can get back to working with Javascript, lol.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Complete the survey page project, and fix the mobile view on the technical documentation page, if there's time
