# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 01/09/21

**End date**: XX/XX/XX

## Goals

* Complete Responsive Web Design Certification
* Complete JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
* Continue coding for an hour each day

## Day 1 - 1/9/21

* **Project You Are Working On:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/KKgZzNN) for the first of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress Today:** Redid the page so it looks more presentable, while still fulfilling the user stories
  * Added a rounded border to the text at the bottom
  * Adjusted margins to get rid of the gaps in the header, and beneath the image
  * Moved the article element below the image instead of next to it. Just misc stuff to make it look neater and more readable
* **Challenges you faced:** I'm not a visual design person. I want to redo these projects to give them more style instead of just blocks of text on a block of background color, but it's been hard to figure out just what to add or change to make it look nicer. I feel like that's one of the biggest issues I'm gonna face with the next four projects. Looking forward to finishing them so I can get back to working with Javascript, lol.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Complete the survey page project, and fix the mobile view on the technical documentation page, if there's time

## Day 2 - 1/10/21
 Another one down! One more project until I get the Web Design certification.
 
* **Project you are working on:** [Survey Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/BaLORmw) the second of the FCC web design projects.
* **Progress today:** Built the survey page
* **Challenges you faced:** Getting the colors right. Honestly it's not the *best* it could be, right now. I'd wanted black text but that blended in with the background image too much so I changed it to a light colored text, but it still feels like it might not be all that readable.. Ugh.
On the bright side, though, these are design issues. I understand the code to change the colors. I'm just not so great on finding the right colors. I'm calling it a win.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Gonna hold off on making the portfolio page until I'm happy with the first four projects (because I'm an insane perfectionist ope) so tomorrow I'll focus on sprucing up the technical documentation page, and redoing the product landing page.

## Day 3 - 1/11/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
* **Progress today:** Adjusted the Nav bar so the links grow and change color when you hover over them. Centered the header under the nav bar at the top
* **Challenges you faced:** Spent way too much time trying to find colors that went well together, and "centering" under just the nav bar links, instead of the logo as well took some time to figure out. And honestly I'm sure there's a better way to do it than guess and check over and over but oh well. The end result looks all right.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Product Landing page

## Day 4 - 1/12/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/QWKVeww)
* **Progress today:** I got it done, I guess. Put the video in a fixed position on the left under the logo so there isnt just the empty space. Adjusted the margins so that the links jump to the right areas on the page without hiding the head under the nav bar. Centered everything and changed the fonts. Not great, but not awful. I'm not doing anything else with this one
* **Challenges you faced:** Centering everything under the right 7/8 of a page instead of the full page was a huge pain. Adjusting the top margins worked so the links jump to the right place but it adds ugly gaps that I'd prefer not be there.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Personal Portfolio webpage

## Day 5 - 1/13/21

* **Project you are working on:** A new and improved [Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/rNMQWeJ) and my [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
* **Progress today:**
   * on the product page: Fixed (some) alignment issues, added color and just made it look a little less boring, and removed the video (needed one to pass the assignment for FCC, but I much prefer the way it looks without)
   * On the Portfolio: Made navbar with links aligned left
   * Started playing around with colors, not sure what exactly I'm going with yet
* **Challenges you faced:** had trouble aligning the navbar links to the right without them showing up in reverse order. honestly I fixed it by accident, I couldnt tell you which change finally had the desired result. having trouble settling on colors but I think I'm going to leave that for last.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** finish, hopefully, the portfolio

## Day 6 - 1/14/21

* **Project you are working on:** [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/aprilblossoms/full/zYKMBJG)
* **Progress today:** Finished it! Settled on a color scheme, got the different sections added and linked to the nav bar. Added the images for the projects section and added some hover effects to different things. I think it looks all right
* **Challenges you faced:** God, so many. Centering the Welcome section took me way too long. I'd just wanted the name and subtitle on top of each other, but sentering one element in the div left the other one next to it instead of below it and nothing I did fixed that, so I improvised... But the result looks pretty good, I think. Sizing the images properly too a bit of time too but honestly less than I expected. 
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Start again with Javascript!

## Day 7 - 1/15/21

* **Project you are working on:** No projects yet, just reviewing JS
* **Progress today:** Started going back over the early JS lessons.
* **Challenges you faced:** None, really. Just how to skip the basic stuff I already know without missing small details I may have forgotten. Don't think there's a way so I'm just going over all of it. Which means probably several days of review.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** More JS review.

## Day 8 - 1/16/21

* **Project you are working on:** More review
* **Progress today:** Got just about through the Basic Javascript section
* **Challenges you faced:** spent like 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with something I'd written that *seemed* to be giving the right results. Turns out the code was right except I'd forgotten to change console.log() back to return once I'd fixed my mistake. Definitely felt dumb there. Now I'm stuck on updating nested arrays in an array of objects. I've tried two solutions. One solves one problem but creates another. Then solving the new problem brings the old one back. I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing wrong, but I've spent enough time on it for today, I'll come back to it in the morning.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** More review. Finishing this section and hopefully the ES6 section, if there's time.

## Day 9 - 1/17/21

* **Project you are working on:** Record Collection challenge on FCC
* **Progress today:** None! An hour working on this thing and I'm not any closer to figuring it out
* **Challenges you faced:** Having trouble with accessing nested objects like, dynamically or whatever. Using a function to update them. I keep getting "cannot set/read property of undefined" when like... they are defined? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Read up on objects like, outside of the freecodecamp lessons. Theres something I'm not understanding about how they work, I'm hoping a deeper dive than the lessons provided so far will help me

## Day 10 - 1/18/2021

* **Project you are working on:** None at the moment
* **Progress today:** Very little. If it can even be considered progress. I'm still stuck on this nested objects/"undefined" thing. I've watched a few videos that basically went over what I already knew and reinforced my belief that it should be working... In addition to the videos, I spent some time looking back over my old projects. Theyre still beyond me. That's what I get for my JS speedrun before quitting for several months. Anyway I'm going to ask for some help tomorrow, maybe he'll show me what it is that I'm missing here. I know there was no actual coding today so it feels a bit like cheating, but I worked towards increasing my understanding at least. 
* **Challenges you faced:** See above.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Ask Rev. 

## Day 11 - 1/19/2021

* **Project you are working on:** The record collection challenge on freeCodeCamp
* **Progress today:** So as it turns out, I just had two numbers mixed up. The entire issue with the "undefined" error message was caused by me using id# 5349 instead of 5439. Unfortunately I'm now stuck on a different aspect of this challenge. It's one I think I understand how to figure out, though. So I'm hoping tomorrow is my last day stuck on this.
* **Challenges you faced:** Checking if the 'tracks' property exists already. I figured *if ( object[id][prop] )*  would return either true or false, but *if ( object[id][prop] == false)* had unexpected results. So I tried switching it to *if ( object[id][prop] != true )* but that only fixed one part but caused a problem with another.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Figure out a better way to check if the property exists. Then finish the collection challenge and move on.

## Day 12 - 1/21/2021

* **Project you are working on:** Record Collection challenge, and the rest of the Basic JS lessons
* **Progress today:** Finally completed that challenge! Got through a few more of the lessons, watched a couple videos on recursion.
* **Challenges you faced:** Not so much a challenge, since I was able to complete it, but is *if (!object[id]\[prop])* not the same as *if (object[id]\[prop] != true)*? I solved this one but I'm a bit confused as to why it worked. I was also a bit confused by recursion, but I think I'm starting to understand a bit better.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** the profile lookup challenge, and whatever other lessons there's time for.

## Day 13 - 1/22/2021

* **Project you are working on:** basic JS section of the Javascript course
* **Progress today:** completed the profileLookup function and some more sections about Math.random() and Math.floor()
* **Challenges you faced:** I thought I understood recursion but this code that looks like it should be working just... isn't. Gonna watch some more videos on it and try to figure out why I'm stuck
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** understand recursion so I can finish the countdown function and finally move on to the next JS section

## Day 14 - 1/23/2021

* **Project you are working on:** Basic JS lessons
* **Progress today:** Completed the countdown function using recursion, watched more videos on recursion
* **Challenges you faced:** creating a recursive function that lists a range of numbers. I keep thinking I have recursion down, just to completely lose it again.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish this function. I'm on the last of the basic JS challenges. 

## Day 15 - 1/24/2021

* **Project you are working on:** Range of numbers function using recursion
* **Progress today:** Finally got it done!
* **Challenges you faced:** I really felt like i understood the concept of recursion but I was struggling when it came to what was being returned, how to store that info into an array without the array changing when the function is called again, etc
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Move on to the ES6 module

## Day 16 - 1/25/2021

* **Project you are working on:** ES6 section on FreeCodeCamp
* **Progress today:** Got about halfway through this section. A lot of this is coming back to me really easily.
* **Challenges you faced:** I'm stuck on getters and setters. This is something that I'm struggling a bit to understand, but I remember that I had trouble understanding them last time too, so Im not letting that discourage me.
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the ES6 section and get started on the next one.

## Day 17 - 1/26/2021

* **Project you are working on:** ES6 section
* **Progress today:** Finished it. Realized the reason I'd been struggling with getters and setters is that I'd been thinking about them way too hard. It's way more straightforward than I was making it out to be, and that had me stuck on a challenge for a good 10 minutes. But! I got it figured out, and completed the rest of this section.
* **Challenges you faced:** There was that challenge I was stuck on, but that wasn't too bad. To be honest though, I did stop after 45 minutes because the next section is Regex and I absolutely hated this section. Not at all looking forward to picking this back up, so I'm leaving it for another day
* **Tasks for tomorrow:** ugh... start the regex section
