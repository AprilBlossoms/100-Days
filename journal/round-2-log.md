# Round 2 Log

**Start date**: 07/26/21
**End date**: xx/xx/xx

## Goals

-   Spend an hour each day learning to code

## Day 1 - 07/26/21

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Does this repo count? Lol I've edited it quite a bit, added the round 2 page, cleaned the README part up. That's coding, right? No?
-   **Progress Today:** In all seriousness, what I'm working on today is the 'getting started' portion of appacademy.io. I'm recommitting to learning to code, but I haven't decided yet what 'course' I'm going with. I'm really liking the way the appacademy lessons are set up, so I'll probably just be jumping around both. Today, I completed the Welcome to Coding section, and got about halfway through the Intro to Programming one.
-   **Challenges you faced:** None really. This is all review so far, the biggest challenge was that I'm going through the lessons while working, so I had to keep pausing to take calls lol.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section
