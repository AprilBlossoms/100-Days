# Round 2 Log

**Start date**: 07/26/21
**End date**: xx/xx/xx

## Goals

-   Spend an hour each day learning to code

## Day 1 - 07/26/21

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Does this repo count? Lol I've edited it quite a bit, added the round 2 page, cleaned the README part up. That's coding, right? No?
-   **Progress Today:** In all seriousness, what I'm working on today is the 'getting started' portion of appacademy.io. I'm recommitting to learning to code, but I haven't decided yet what 'course' I'm going with. I'm really liking the way the appacademy lessons are set up, so I'll probably just be jumping around both that and freeCodeCamp. Today, I completed the Welcome to Coding section, and got about halfway through the Intro to Programming one.
-   **Challenges you faced:** None really. This is all review so far, the biggest challenge was that I'm going through the lessons while working, so I had to keep pausing to take calls lol.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section

## Day 2 - 07/27/21

-   **Project you are working on:** The Intro to Programming section on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Got most of it done between calls at work tonight. It's all just reviewing very basic concepts that I've already 'reviewed' so many times at this point. It's embarrassing how many times I stop trying to learn for a period of time, then come back to it and feel like I have to start all over, then make it through all the basics and then something comes up so I stop putting time into programming again. It almost feels like cheating to count these first days lol. But, it's time that I'm dedicating to it each day. Even if it isn't particularly challenging.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Uh, WTF is up with Ruby? Lol so I know all the concepts already, but I learned them in JS. So I'm like *ok, method. That's a function. But wait... where are your brackets? def..end? That's weird. I don't like that.* 'Challenges' today were just trying to unlearn the JS I know. Not the concepts, just the little things, where it looks a bit different in a different programming language. Even if it is weird. (How can you call a function without the parenthesis? If it doesn't take any arguments, fine I guess. Still feels... idk, incomplete. But like. greet "John" instead of greet("John") ?? One of those just doesn't feel right lol)
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section
