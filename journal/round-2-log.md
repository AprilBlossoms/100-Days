# Round 2 Log

**Start date**: 07/26/21
**End date**: xx/xx/xx

## Goals

-   Spend an hour each day learning to code

## Day 1 - 07/26/21

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Does this repo count? Lol I've edited it quite a bit, added the round 2 page, cleaned the README part up. That's coding, right? No?
-   **Progress Today:** In all seriousness, what I'm working on today is the 'getting started' portion of appacademy.io. I'm recommitting to learning to code, but I haven't decided yet what 'course' I'm going with. I'm really liking the way the appacademy lessons are set up, so I'll probably just be jumping around both that and freeCodeCamp. Today, I completed the Welcome to Coding section, and got about halfway through the Intro to Programming one.
-   **Challenges you faced:** None really. This is all review so far, the biggest challenge was that I'm going through the lessons while working, so I had to keep pausing to take calls lol.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section

## Day 2 - 07/27/21

-   **Project you are working on:** The Intro to Programming section on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Got most of it done between calls at work tonight. It's all just reviewing very basic concepts that I've already 'reviewed' so many times at this point. It's embarrassing how many times I stop trying to learn for a period of time, then come back to it and feel like I have to start all over, then make it through all the basics and then something comes up so I stop putting time into programming again. It almost feels like cheating to count these first days lol. But, it's time that I'm dedicating to it each day. Even if it isn't particularly challenging.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Uh, WTF is up with Ruby? Lol so I know all the concepts already, but I learned them in JS. So I'm like *ok, method. That's a function. But wait... where are your brackets? def..end? That's weird. I don't like that.* 'Challenges' today were just trying to unlearn the JS I know. Not the concepts, just the little things, where it looks a bit different in a different programming language. Even if it is weird. (How can you call a function without the parenthesis? If it doesn't take any arguments, fine I guess. Still feels... idk, incomplete. But like. greet "John" instead of greet("John") ?? One of those just doesn't feel right lol)
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Intro to Programming section

## Day 3 - 07/28/21

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** The sections on Conditionals, Loops, and most of the one on Arrays, I just have a few more of the exercises for that one to do. I've underestimated the challenges here, lol. I'm not expecting to finish the entire Intro to Programming part in a day anymore. Maybe a section and a half is a more practical estimate.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I keep trying to write in javascript I think. I'm forgetting to add 'end' in the right places, and also keep doing 'else if' instead of 'elsif'. Little things like that, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the arrays exercises, then complete the lectures and exercises on Enumerables and Ranges.

## Day 4 - 07/29/21

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Finished the arrays exercises, and the Enumerables and Ranges lectures section.
-   **Challenges you faced:** --
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the exercises, and then get through the at least the lectures on the Nested Loops and 2D Arrays section.

## Day 5 - 7/30/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Intro to Programming on appacademy
-   **Progress today:** Got through a few of the challenges, but I'm going to need to rewatch a few of the lectures tomorrow.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Some of the challenges have me stumped, but I think it's because I'm overcomplicating things.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** I'm too tired to rewatch anything tonight. I'm going to go over the lectures for this section again, and then tackle the rest of the challenges tomorrow.

## Day 6 - 7/31/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** No real project, just kind of jumping around with things.
-   **Progress today:** Did a lot of reading about APIs (still don't quite understand) and played around with the start of some of the other courses on freeCodeCamp. I followed along the appacademy video tutorials about installing ubuntu and ruby. Shortly before deciding I didn't want to focus on learning Ruby right now. ope.
-   **Challenges you faced:** APIs dont quite make sense to me. I mean they do, just not how to implement them like within code. But I was really all over the place with what I was reading about so it's not really discouraging that I was confused. I just haven't gotten there yet. I also struggled with ubuntu because the tutorial was for a different version of it I guess. I figured out what the issue was there, but again it doesn't really matter since I'm not using appacademy I don't think. For now, at least.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Pick a dang project, April.

## Day 7 - 8/1/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** I started learning Python! Currently working through the Python for Everybody course
-   **Progress today:** Completed through exercise 3.2. And got a lot more comfortable with the Command Prompt. It was just scary before, but following these lessons kind of made it seem less scary and more.. simple. It feels way more straightforward now. Also added the py4e repo to github so I can share my progress on there.
-   **Challenges you faced:** The Command Prompt took me a minute to get used to, but other than that the only real issues I had were forgetting to add the extension (both when creating new files in atom, and when trying to access the file in the Command Prompt.)
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** I'll be doing a few more exercises at work tonight, so I'm not sure exactly where I'll have left off at. I'd like to get through at least the Functions, Loops, and Strings sections. But again, that depends on how much of that I get done tonight.

## Day 8 - 8/2/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Python for Everybody
-   **Progress today:** Finished the Loops and Strings sections
-   **Challenges you faced:** it's gonna take me a minute to stop using js (syntax? I think that's the word I'm looking for here). instead of str.split() its str(:). I kept messing up in that way, but I'm getting the hang of it.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Files and Lists lessons

## Day 9 - 08/03/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Python for Everybody
-   **Progress today:** Completed the Files and Lists lessons
-   **Challenges you faced:** just a bunch of little syntax errors that had me rewriting code, only to realize my mistake and go with my original answer, minus the minor error that was breaking it. I think I'm doing all right though, not really struggling at this point.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Get started on the Dictionaries lesson. I'm at a point where I've got to watch the lectures as well, I can't just read the lesson and do the exercises, so I think I'll be spending more time on the lessons now, instead of going through multiple ones a day.

## Day 10 - 08/04/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Took a break from PY4E to do watch a bunch of videos. I'd like to start working on some sort of project but I don't know what just yet, and so I've been jumping around to get ideas of what I should learn so that I can build something. That's a bit backwards, isn't it? Oh well.
-   **Progress today:** Learned a lot about sqlite3 and started following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo) flask tutorial to build a blog webapp. I think that's what I'm going to go with, focus on learning python and flask. I'll be back to the PY4E probably tomorrow (I'm typing this 8/5 ope.)
-   **Challenges you faced:** Indecision and impulsivity. My own bs lol. I need to sit down and figure out what I want to make and then try to find what I need in order to do that right? But instead I'm jumping around all sorts of different subjects and thinking of all the ways I could use those, even though I'm still at a very surface level understanding of everything. I was trying to do too much is all. Made me spend a lot of time looking up extra junk.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Finish the Flask blog video tutorial


## Day 11 - 08/05/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo) flask blog tutorial
-   **Progress today:** Got through part 3, Forms and User Input
-   **Challenges you faced:** lots of syntax errors, but it was actually really refreshing because I was able to find and fix them on my own. It feels good to not be googling everything. Even though I made a lot of mistakes, I was able to find and fix them all very quickly
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** More of the flask blog tutorial, but also complete the dictionaries lesson on PY4E.

## Day 12 - 08/06/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Well, I wanted to build like a to-do list sort of app that would let me keep track of the homeschool lessons we're doing with the girls. These are what we need to go over today, here are videos to watch for today, etc.
-   **Progress today:** Following along with the flask blog tutorial I sort of cherry picked the things I needed to apply. I made the home page, the 'todays lesson' page, and a page that will allow me to add to the units
-   **Challenges you faced:** I couldn't figure out how to get it to actually read the data from the db. I was struggling in general with how to create the tables and update and access them. Every time I came back to it with a new plan, it still wasn't quite right.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** --

## Day 13 - 08/07/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson plan app
-   **Progress today:** I figured it out! I have spent hours working on this. Watching tutorials, reading, trying to piece together what it was that I was doing wrong and I finally got it! As usual, I was trying to overcomplicate things. I didn't need more than one table, and that's where I was getting thrown most of the time. Now I've updated it to access the info from the db, and to update the table as needed.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Struggling with the database a lot, and then with getting it to return the right string, instead of Task(1.1, 'This is task 1').
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Some basic styling, get a nav bar added, and then start on the dictionaries lesson on PY4E

## Day 14 - 08/08/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson plan app. and my naming skills.
-   **Progress today:** Made a way to add videos that will appear below the to-do list, so everything is all in one place instead of having to find if/where I bookmarked them.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Again with the database thing. It was a simple fix though, I think the problem was when I was following the tutorial to set it up as a package, it was still referencing the original db instead of the new blank one that had been made. Anyway, this has been like 20 mins. I'll spend more time later working on adding a nav bar.

## Day 14 1/2 - 08/08/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson plan app. I've given up on the naming skills.
-   **Progress today:** Added a nav bar, with a link to add a task, add a vid, or go home. The add links will redirect home after you click submit. the home page asks for the unit, and will take you to the to-do list for the day.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I was trying to put a form inside the nav bar that would let you enter the unit there and get taken to that days to-do list. I couldn't get it quite right, though. Everytime I fixed all the other errors, I ended up back at the same issue where 'tasks' is called before it's defined. I understand what the issue means, but I couldn't figure out how to fix it so I gave up for now.
    **Tasks for tomorrow:** Add a title or description space to the videos section, and create a "done" button that will update the database. I'd like the 'home' page to open on the most recent unit. Then 'done' will update the database and update the home page. Maybe. I'll see, I'm not sure yet.
    I'm gonna stop adding the PY4E lessons on my to do list because I keep not doing them. I'll get back to it eventually, I'm sure.

## Day 15 - 08/09/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson Plan app
-   **Progress today:** I got a description section added for the videos.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Adding the description part to the database was easy. Figuring out how to access it took me so so long. At first glance it seems convenient to set the variables the way I have been. videos=videos, sure. The list returned by the query is the video list we'll loop through once the page loads. But then.. where is the description? Which 'videos' variable contains that? Hint: not the one I was using for the first half hour.
  But again, that was an easy fix, and it helped me understand more about what my code is doing so no complaints here.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** The 'Done' button, potentially. And figure out how I want to handle the home page.

## Day 16 - 08/10/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson Planner
-   **Progress today:** Took a bit of a detour tonight, and decided to work on adding individual pages for each of the girls. I'd like to have an individual to-do list for each of them that can be updated like, at the end of the day. I got a page for Naomi made, and a "Done" button added to the bottom of the page
-   **Challenges you faced:** I can't figure out how make the button... do things. I thought it'd be way simpler than the forms but i'm not sure how to reference the information that I want to delete, without some sort of input field. Maybe i'll add like a checkbox for the tasks to delete.
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Get the delete button working.

## Day 17 - 08/11/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** None. Watching/Reading through various flask and python tutorials. This is a cheat day, while I try to figure out what next steps I'm taking.

## Day 18 - 08/12/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** None. I missed today, no coding, unless you count pseudo code and me trying to figure out why my lesson plan app messed up. Blahh. I'll be back to work on it tomorrow.

## Day 18 Take 2 - 08/13/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson planner thing. I started over.
-   **Progress today:** Well, since I started from 0 I'd say I got a lot accomplished today. I can add the to-do list and the videos, and go to specific units. I am stuck on how to delete tasks though. I thought it'd be simple to just have a button that 'updates' the db by removing each task with that days unit, but I haven't figured it out yet.
I also got the pages for the girls individual to do lists added but haven't gotten them to display anything right. There's the input area, but it doesn't connect to the database, and the current info from the database doesn't show up.
-   **Challenges you faced:** See above
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Work on the two issues I've been working on, I guess. First, fix the individual todo list pages. Then work on adding an update option.

## Day 19 - 08/14/2021

-   **Project you are working on:** Lesson Planner
-   **Progress today:** Got checkboxes added, now I just need to figure out how to connect them to the db. But they're showing up on the page and at least doing something, so that's progress. ...Came back to this several hours later and decided to trash the individual todo lists. They weren't a part of what I initially wanted to be making anyway. Instead, I got an update button added to the page that successfully deletes the first thing in the db. Now the problem.. I need it to delete the first several things in the db. I also added some formatting, not a whole lot just making it look a tiny bit neater. And I made the task into a link so it will link to the pages we're reading from, or the instructions for an art project, etc.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Working with the database has been a struggle for me. I guess that's to be expected when I jump in without actually trying to learn how they work first. *shrug* Anyway I just need to write some sort of while loop or something that checks if the unit is the same as the current unit, and if so delete that one as well
-   **Tasks for tomorrow:** Fix the update button and create a try/except or something so that it doesn't mess up when trying to load a page for a unit with no tasks entered
