# Round 3 Log

**Start date**: 08/17/21
**End date**:


## Goals

-   Make a tarot journal/tracker app that can log readings and track reoccurring cards.
-   Practice coding or following some sort of lesson for a minimum of 30 mins each day. (I'm being realistic this time, sue me lol)

## Day 1 - 08/17/21
#60+ mins

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Tarot journal
-   **Progress Today:** I sketched out what I'd like to make, and started doing some more reading about Flask and watching a few tutorials.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I keep getting thrown when it comes to using the database, so I know that's going to be one of the more challenging parts of this.

## Day 2 - 08/18/21
#60+ mins

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Tarot journal
-   **Progress Today:** Lots and lots of tutorials. I'm so confused about creating a database, and how the relationships will work, as it applies to what I'm wanting to make.
-   **Challenges you faced:** Learn more about Django and if it's something I want to learn and use for this, instead of Flask

## Day 3 - 08/19/21
#60+ mins

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Tarot Journal
-   **Progress Today:** Started following a Django tutorial for making a blog, but making changes so that it fit my tarot journal idea.

## Day 4 - 08/20/21
#60+ mins

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Tarot Journal
-   **Progress Today:** Followed another Flask blog tutorial while making changes to it to suit what I'm working on.
-   **Challenges you faced:** I've got like 3 incomplete projects right now because I keep starting to follow these tutorials, realizing I'm in way over my head, and then going off to start something different. I don't want to start learning all the way at the beginning, because I've got this idea in my head that I want to make and I'm eager to work on it. But, I just don't know enough to work on it yet. I'm finally accepting it's not practical to learn all this as I go, and am gonna start at the beginning tomorrow I think.

## Day 5 - 08/21/21
#60+ mins

-   **Project You Are Working On:** Tarot Journal
-   **Progress Today:** So much! I decided to go back to it again, starting over but this time taking what I've learned from the tutorials and kind of piecing something together on my own, instead of trying to follow along with the video as I build something completely different. I know I still need to go back and start at the beginning, but I've learned enough to put this together and I've worked through so much of the stuff I'd been struggling with. Anyway, so far today I've: Got the general layout set up, created the database with the foreign keys and relationships set up right (finally!), created a form so a reading can be added to the database. The home page lists all the current readings, and you can sort by querent. I also got some images added
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow:** See about tags? Find a way to add the cards to the readings. Otherwise, work on the draw a card section. Add javascript?
