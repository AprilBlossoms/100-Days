<h1 align="center"> #100DaysofCode Round 5</h1>

**Start date**: 10/18/2022
**End date**: TBD


## Day 1: Tuesday, October 18, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** Homeschool Manager
-   **Today's Progress** Created the basic flask structure and got the database up and running. Created user registration and login (just with a username, I'm not worried about using passwords for this since it's just for the kids). I think I've got the database structure how I want it, but we'll see.
-   **Thoughts:** I'm concerned about how to track their progress. I created a Lesson table separate from the 'Topic' table, that will hold each of the lessons with a link to the user, and each one will track how many stars they've gotten for that lesson. I think that will be good enough, but I wonder if there's not a more succinct way to do it.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow (or today after work)** A few things I could work on.
        - Style the login and register pages. Not high on my priorities, but I want to keep my code organized and I think styling as I go will save me the headache of figuring out what's what later on
        - Create a way to add lessons from the app
        - Add some example lessons so I can start playing around with the quiz functionality and seeing if my database setup is going to work.

## Day 2: Wednesday, October 19, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** Homeschool Manager
-   **Today's Progress** I made it pretty! Well, pretty ish. It looks good enough lol. I also created a quiz route and have started on the logic to select just the current lesson, but I'm kind of stumped. I think there's a better way to set up the database but I'm not really sure what that is yet.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Work more on the quiz route

## Day 3: Thursday, October 20, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** Homeschool Manager
-   **Today's Progress** Nada. Spent most of the hour arguing with the database. I thought adding to the user a current_lesson_id column linking it to the lessons table would work, but I couldn't get flask migrate to actually update the database.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Start a new project, I think.

## Day 4: Friday, October 21, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** kivy Tarot journal and Homeschool Manager
-   **Today's Progress** started a new kivy project, got login and register functionality made before realizing I don't want to figure out the database stuff right now, so i switched back to the Homeschool Manager. I figured out how to get the current lessons on the quiz page, and am stuck on styling the page now. Having issues with the bootstrap accordion, which isn't a huge deal because I'm not certain an accordion is what I want to go with anyway. Maybe just cards.. we'll see.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Will work on styling the quiz page more tomorrow, and maybe add to the tarot app.

## Day 5: Saturday, October 22, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** Homeschool manager
-   **Today's Progress** It's functional! And almost pretty, lol. I'm really proud of myself, I thought this would take me several months to figure out. I got the progress bars on the front page working, and you can add a percentage for each subject on the quiz page, which will add stars if the percentage is over 90. Once you have 3 stars, that subject will be completed and it will move on to the next one. Once every topic in a subject is completed, the progress bar resets to 0 and it assigns you that subject in the next grade.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow**

## Day 6: Sunday, October 23, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** EHR
-   **Today's Progress** Decided to ditch the homeschool thing and work on creating an EHR. Working with one had me wondering if I could build something like it, so now here we are. It will be very basic I think, but I think there's a lot that is within my capabilities. Got practice and user registration done today. And I'm styling as I go, so it even looks pretty so far. Pretty proud of myself
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Create the home page and the ability to add patients

## Day 7: Monday, October 24,2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** EHR
-   **Today's Progress** Did some more styling. I'm actually starting to like it lol. And it turns out in my rush to finish the login and registration stuff, I forgot to add a password field to the register form, ope. So I got that fixed, make sure registration and logging in works the right way, and created a practice home page complete with navbar. Okay, bootstrap made the navbar. But i put it in the right place!
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** add more functionality to the home page and the ability to add patients

## Day 8: Tuesday, October 25, 2022
-   **Project You Are Working On** EHR
-   **Today's Progress** not much. Started on the add patient form and realized it's going to be a lot of work to get it set up how I want. Not letting that discourage me though! Will start creating the html tomorrow.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Add patient
