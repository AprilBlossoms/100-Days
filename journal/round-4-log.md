## Day 2: Monday December 13, 2021
-   **Todayâ€™s Progress**: Added the ability to choose an image, and made it work whether or not there was an image included
-   **Thoughts:** Couldn't find how to add media using v2 of the API. I must have been overlooking something but I really struggled with that before I realized I could just switch to v1 which was a lot more clear.

## Day 3: Tuesday December 14, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Added some color, text wrapping, and clearing the entry boxes after a tweet is submitted.
-   **Thoughts:** I'm not good at design, like at all. It's an area I really want to improve.

## Day 4: Wednesday December 15, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Accidentally deleted all of my projects.. All of them. I don't want to talk about it.
-   **Thoughts:** Well.. time to start rebuilding I guess. Starting organizing my code from replit to put on here.

## Day 7: Saturday December 18, 2021
-   **Today's Progress**: Redid the blackjack game, with the tutorial, and the higher-lower game on my own.
-   **Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the blackjack one. I think I was trying to do too much within one function, I should have broken it down more. Ended up following the tutorial to finish that one, but I was able to do the other from scratch.

## Day 8: Sunday December 19, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Completed projects 15 and 16 without the tutorial. The Coffee Machine and then the OOP version of the Coffee Machine
-  **Thoughts**: I rushed through these sections before and it led to me struggling a lot with classes and OOP. I'm a lot more comfortable after slowing down and having redone this project. I'm feeling a lot better about using classes now.

## Day 11: Wednesday December 22, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Started rebuilding my tarot-journal. Got the basic flask setup done, then I got sidetracked with astrology stuff. Played around with the flatlib libary and figured out how to create charts and access the data from them
-  **Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time fighting with the library because the pyswisseph wasn't finding a file it needed... I'm thinking the error had something to do with the virtual environment, and I'm fairly sure my bandaid fix won't work as a permanent solution, but for now it's doing what I want it to.

## Day 12: Thursday December 23, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Set up a login and register template and started choosing some colors for them.
-  **Thoughts**: I want to do this without using any templates, which means I'll be spending a long time on these probably. I want it to be responsive and web design in general is just not my strong suit. Got a lot to learn!

## Day 13: Friday December 24, 2021
-  **Today's Progress**: Got a card centered in the page and added a shadow. It's not much but getting the card the right size and positioned how I wanted took me longer than expected
-  **Thoughts**: It occurrs to me that this would be easier if I'd sketched out what I want it to look like beforehand.
