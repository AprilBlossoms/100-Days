**Today’s Progress**: Added the ability to choose an image, and made it work whether or not there was an image included
**Thoughts:** Couldn't find how to add media using v2 of the API. I must have been overlooking something but I really struggled with that before I realized I could just switch to v1 which was a lot more clear.

**Today’s Progress**: Added some color, text wrapping, and clearing the entry boxes after a tweet is submitted.
**Thoughts:** I'm not good at design, like at all. It's an area I really want to improve.
