# #100DaysOfCode - Seventh Attempt

Welcome to my seventh attempt at the #100DaysOfCode challenge! This repository will document my journey as I commit to coding for 100 days. Each day, I will update this README with my progress, challenges, and things I learned.

## Challenge Rules

1. I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. I will tweet my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
