# Round 3 Log

## **Start date**: 10/25/2023
## **End date**: TBD


## Goals

-   Create a Stardew Valley clone with pygame (sort of. Basically Stardew Valley, but with some original ideas thrown in)
-   Code for an hour each day.

###  Day 1 - 10/25/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** So I had already followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c) tutorial on making a Stardew Valley like game in Pygame, but I made my own map in tiled, and changed a few things like the house, you zone into it instead of the roof disappearing when you're in it. And I added mouse click functionality. So that's my starting code. I spent most of today trying to start from scratch and refactor the code to use a Game State Manager. But... that didn't work out well. and I've got zoning down (I think). So I'm just gonna use my starting code and build from there. I got a hotbar added to the overlay, and a time/date/season display in the top right corner. And I've got a hotbar selected image that moves when you press q and e.
-   **Thoughts:** I really would have liked to refactor the code and start from scratch but I just couldn't get it working right. Not a huge deal though, I'll start from my base project and go from there.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Work on the hotbar. Adding items to it, using the selected item, etc. Will probably need to work on the inventory as well in order to do this.

###  Day 2 - 10/26/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** got an open and closeable inventory menu, and confirmed wood was added to it when I chopped down a tree. Also got the tools added to the hotbar. I'm gonna keep all the tools in hotbar slot 1, and not have them take up an inventory slot. Then when you press the arrow keys it will filter through the tools. So far that's working well. Gotta get the seed going next
-   **Thoughts:** Decided to handle the inventory using a new class and a nested dictionary. not sure if the dictionary was the best route. I'm pretty sure it is, but it sure took me a minute to figure out how to access the values I needed.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Get the seeds added to the hotbar. Should work the same as the tools, but will be a bit more difficult because the amount of seeds varies and there are times when you'll have no seeds, but I don't want that hotbar slot to be able to be filled with something else.

###  Day 3 - 10/27/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Started a youtube channel! Also decided I am going to go ahead and refactor my code so I'll be starting over. Worked on just the basic game setup today. Will probably have that video up tomorrow. In the meantime, you can check out my introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/gJKbW5L-WCk)
-   **Thoughts:** Excited and nervous about doing a code along thing. Especially since I'm always starting and stopping projects. This will give me reason to keep going, having an audience (assuming I get an audience lol). We'll see how it goes.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Get the base of my code refactored (game loop, cursor sprite, title menu) and get my second video (first actual code along video) uploaded

###  Day 4 - 10/28/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Started refactoring to use a game state manager. Got the title screen done and added the custom cursor in. Got my second video posted! Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsMZmaQBf5E&t=1s)
-   **Thoughts:** Making the video is the part that takes the longest, because I spend so much time re recording and stuff. Gotta find a better way of doing it, probably recording small clips at a time so if I fuck up I dont have to start all over. As far as the code goes, though, it was smooth sailing today.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Maybe add the load save screen in. That won't take long. Then work on adding in the player class and recreating the game world.

###  Day 5 - 10/29/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Got the code to show the player on the screen
-   **Thoughts:** Took way longer than it should have, because I already have the player class created. I had to figure out which bits were necessary and which to omit until further into the development.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Get the character moving.

###  Day 6 - 11/1/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Got the character moving, and then the hotbar added with the ability to cycle through the options in the hotbar, or cycle through the selected tool. Confirmed my tool use animation is working as expected.
-   **Thoughts:** Smooth sailing, aside from a few typos
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** New video on creating the map in tiled, and then creating the farm map in pygame.

###  Day 7 - 11/2/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** got the farm map added to the game, with everything but the stumps, because I haven't created the class for them yet. Also uploaded a new video, going briefly over how I created my map in Tiled and then how to put the tiled map in the game.
-   **Thoughts:** Everythings going well still, I think
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Get the stumps added, and add collisions

###  Day 8 - 11/3/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Got the collisions and stumps added, and the ability to chop down trees
-   **Thoughts:** had a bit of an issue, where the stumps were being created, I know because I was running into them. However, the images just weren't appearing on the screen. I think it had something to do with where I called super().__init__ in the stump class, whatever it was, when I copied the Tree class, pasted it in and changed the name to Stump, it worked so *shrug*.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Add the inventory menu, and a way to display the wood that's added to the inventory when we chop down a tree

###  Day 9 - 11/4/2023
-   **Project** Pydew Valley
-   **Today's Progress** Got the inventory added and confirmed wood was added to it 
-   **Thoughts:** It's gonna take me a minute to figure out how to get the plants added to the inventory. I've got to first add planting things, so that I can attempt harvesting them and make sure it works. but before I can add planting things I've gt to get a way to add seeds to the inventory. Which I can jsut do by having the character start the game with some in their inventory, but I considered working on the town map next and adding the ability to buy seeds. I think just placing some in the inventory to start is the right route. Just to get things starteed and make sure it's all working well, then I'll work on the shop and stuff later.
-   **Tasks For Tomorrow** Add the ability to till soil, plant and water plants, and harvest them
